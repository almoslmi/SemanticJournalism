# Call for Papers


Call for Contributions to the Semantic and knowledge graph advances for journalism Workshop at CIKM 2020
Submit by: July 24, 2020
Workshop: October 19, 2020
Details: https://almoslmi.github.io/SemanticJournalism/


# Aim & scope

The aims of the workshop to attract papers on the development in the use of KGs in journalism and also to discuss the main challenges to the adaptation of this technology. Moreover, the workshop aims to cover both technological and scientific aspects related to KGs as well as practical deployment and commercial exploitation. To this purpose, the workshop welcomes papers on different aspects of the use of KGs in journalism, for instance,  journalism KGs generation, enrichment, and evaluation; ii) ontologies & linked open data for journalism; iii) techniques and applications of KGs; iv) and mining journalism KGs.
