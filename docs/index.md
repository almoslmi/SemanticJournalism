# News

Following the [CIKM2020 Organizing Committee announcement](https://cikm2020.org/) and due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this workshop and all other CIKM2020 events will be running completely online. Detail will be provided as soon as possible.

# Abstract

A massive amount of news information is being shared online every day by individuals and media companies. It is difficult for a human to deal with this large-scale data without computational support. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are emerging as a representation infrastructure to support the organisation, integration and representation of journalistic content. KGs are used in numerous applications such as search, question answering, recommendation systems, data integration and across diverse application domains such as geosciences, healthcare, finance, e-commerce, oil and gas, creative industries and cultural heritage. In recent years, KGs have started to emerge in the journalism domain and it was, for example, the technology being used for processing the [Panama papers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAlu3ud2k_A). The goal of this workshop is to look at the recent development in the use of KGs in journalism and also to discuss the main challenges to the adaptation of this technology. Moreover, the workshop aims to cover both technological and scientific aspects related to KGs as well as practical deployment and commercial exploitation. Specifically, the workshop will focus on four different aspects: i) journalism KGs generation, enrichment, and evaluation; ii) ontologies & linked open data for journalism; iii) techniques and applications of KGs; iv) and mining journalism KGs. This workshop is an excellent chance to inspire experts and researchers to share theoretical and practical knowledge of the various aspects related to KGs applications for journalism and to help them convert their ideas into the innovations of the future.
